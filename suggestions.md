Based on the error logs, there are two distinct issues preventing your React Native app from running correctly after a successful build:
Issue 1: Incompatible React versions
The Incompatible React versions error is a critical issue that occurs when there is a mismatch between the versions of react and react-native-renderer. The log shows:
react: 19.1.1
react-native-renderer: 19.1.0
This kind of exact version mismatch is often caused by an update to one package but not the other, or by a dependency that pulls in a different version of react.
How to fix:
Open your package.json file.
Ensure that both react and react-native are using the same minor version (the first two numbers).
Manually correct the version to be identical, for example, by running:
sh
npm install react@19.1.0 react-native@0.75.0 --save
Use code with caution.

(Note: Use 0.75.0 as an example; find the corresponding react-native version for your project's react version.)
After updating, delete your node_modules folder and package-lock.json file.
Run npm install to get a fresh install with the correct versions.
Restart your Metro bundler and try running the app again.
Issue 2: "TempAndroidProject" has not been registered
The Invariant Violation is a common error that occurs when the JavaScript application is not properly registered with the native platform. The message TempAndroidProject has not been registered is a strong clue.
Common causes:
Incorrect app.json or index.js/index.ts: The name used in your index.ts file (AppRegistry.registerComponent) must exactly match the name defined in app.json and the name used by the native project.
Incorrect Build Process: Since you recently changed the package name, it's possible that the native build is still looking for a different project name.
Failed Module Load: An error during the initial JavaScript loading could prevent AppRegistry.registerComponent from ever being called.
How to fix:
Check your index.ts:
Open W:\CodeDeX\AlterEgo-AI\mobile\index.ts.
Find the line AppRegistry.registerComponent.
Ensure the component name matches the name field in your app.json.
index.ts: AppRegistry.registerComponent('AlterEgoNative', () => App);
app.json: "name": "AlterEgoNative"
Clean the project: A clean build will ensure that any lingering cache from previous builds is cleared.
