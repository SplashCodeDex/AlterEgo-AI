The problem
Version mismatch: Your package.json shows you have Tailwind v4 ("tailwindcss": "^4.1.13") and @tailwindcss/postcss installed [package.json].
Vite configuration: Your Vite setup is trying to process Tailwind using PostCSS, which is the older method.
Conflicting plugins: In Tailwind v4, the PostCSS plugin logic was moved to a separate @tailwindcss/postcss package. However, if you're using Vite, the recommended and more performant approach is to use the new @tailwindcss/vite plugin instead, which replaces the need for a PostCSS config entirely.
The solution: Switch to the Vite plugin
The fix involves updating your project to use the dedicated Tailwind Vite plugin for v4. This is the simplest and most performant solution.
Step 1: Remove unnecessary dependencies
Remove the old Tailwind PostCSS plugin and the PostCSS dependencies from your project, as they are no longer needed for this setup.
bash
npm uninstall @tailwindcss/postcss autoprefixer
Use code with caution.

Step 2: Install the new Vite plugin
Install the dedicated Tailwind Vite plugin.
bash
npm install -D @tailwindcss/vite
Use code with caution.

Step 3: Update your vite.config.ts
Modify your vite.config.ts file to import and use the new @tailwindcss/vite plugin.
